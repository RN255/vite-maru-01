Install vite

Install react bootstrap

Clear App.css and Index.css - We're using bootstrap now

Create components folder
    Add a navbar
    Use "rfc" to create boilerplate

Create a pages folder
    Why not create a Home.jsx page?

Use react
    className="container" - and so on...

Instal React Router Dom
    npm install react-router-dom
    Put the wrapper in main.jsx
    Add routes to app.jsx


Vite layout
    Keep main.jsx tiny
        Browser router wrapping (only) will go in here at some point
    App.jsx should be high level structure
        Routes will go in here
