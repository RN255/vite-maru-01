Install vite

Install react bootstrap

Clear App.css and Index.css - We're using bootstrap now

Create components folder
    Add a navbar
    Use "rfc" to create boilerplate

Create a pages folder
    Why not create a Home.jsx page?

Use react
    className="container" - and so on...

Instal React Router Dom
    npm install react-router-dom
    Put the wrapper in main.jsx
    Add routes to app.jsx


Vite layout
    Keep main.jsx tiny
        Browser router wrapping (only) will go in here at some point
    App.jsx should be high level structure
        Routes will go in here
        Global components like NavBar will go in here

Import a font from google fonts
use @import and then *{} in css file

Customise your buttons
    Create custom css

Import some icons
    follow instructions for bootstrap instructions
    gpt will help you will referencing it in the css file

Get your site running again with
    npm run dev

Let's make some links
    if you’re using React Router:
        <Button as={Link} to="/about">About</Button>
            And import Link at top

If react bootstrap components look bad, you might have to state you're in dark mode
    <div data-bs-theme="dark">
      <Alert variant="danger">
        <Alert.Heading>Important Note</Alert.Heading>
          <p>Some info that's really important.</p>
      </Alert>
    </div>

### If you're going to update - you've done to here ###

Add some lasers
    Use keyframes
    Use relative for parent and element above, absolute for element underneath
    set the z-index to correct levels

Fade in some elements
    Use keyframes and opacity

Fade in box shadow
    use transition 0.4s ease on element, use :hover to fade in on hover

Reveal elements on scroll using useEffect() and IntersectionObserver
    Set to hidden in css

    Control the colour scheme with state in app.jsx
